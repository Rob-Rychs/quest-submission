## Chapter 1 Day 1

1. An openly visible and decentralized database anyone can interact with. https://www.investopedia.com/terms/b/blockchain.asp

2. A smart contract is a piece of code that executes and runs either a transaction (updates state) or a script (reads state) of a blockchain.

3. a transaction (updates state on-chain) and costs gas and a script (reads state) of a blockchain and is free.

## Chapter 1 Day 2

1. 
-Safety and Security: Every Smart Contract must be secure. Cadence maximizes efficiency while maintaining the highest levels of safety and security. It accomplishes this because of its insanely strong type system, separation between contracts and transactions, and Resource Oriented Programming.

-Clarity: Code should be easy to read, especially Smart Contract code so that we, as users, can verify it is safe. This is achieved by making the code declarative and allowing the developer to express their intentions directly. Cadence makes those intentions very clear by design, which, along with readability, make auditing and reviewing more efficient.

-Approachability: The way Cadence is written is very familiar to other programming languages, making it easy to transition to if you have prior experience.
Developer Experience: The developer should be able to debug in an easy manner, understand what does where, and not feel frustrated. Cadence does this by making error messages very clear.

-Resource Oriented Programming: This is by far the most important, Cadence at its core uses things called Resources, and they define pretty much everything we do on Flow. Everything is a resource.

2. Ease of adoption, best practices, clearly solving existing issues.

## Chapter 2 Day 1

1. frontend: what the user sees and interacts with; backend: a behind the scenes complicated task like heavy data computing on the server, load=-balancing etc.


2. global styling: are styls applied globally to every element in the DOM; module styling: modular styles applied only to the correspondig class/element/component
